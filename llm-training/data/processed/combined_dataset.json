        "content": "The transit method detects exoplanets by observing periodic dimming of a star's light as a planet passes in front of it. When an exoplanet transits across the face of its host star from our perspective, it blocks a small fraction of the star's light, causing a temporary decrease in brightness. This method is highly effective for detecting planets with orbital planes aligned with our line of sight and has been responsible for discovering thousands of exoplanets, including those found by the Kepler Space Telescope."

        "content": "The habitable zone, also called the Goldilocks zone, is the region around a star where liquid water could exist on a planet's surface. We determine this by calculating the distance range where a planet receives enough stellar radiation to maintain temperatures between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C. This depends on the star's luminosity, temperature, and the planet's atmospheric composition. For our Sun, the habitable zone extends roughly from 0.95 to 1.37 AU. However, factors like atmospheric greenhouse effects, planetary mass, and magnetic field strength also influence habitability."

        "content": "The radial velocity method, also known as the Doppler method, detects exoplanets by measuring the wobble of a star caused by gravitational interaction with orbiting planets. As a planet orbits its star, both objects orbit around their common center of mass (barycenter). This causes the star to move slightly toward and away from Earth, creating a Doppler shift in the star's spectral lines. By precisely measuring these periodic shifts in the star's spectrum, astronomers can determine the planet's orbital period, minimum mass, and orbital eccentricity."

        "content": "Exoplanet atmospheres are studied primarily through spectroscopy during transits and eclipses. During a transit, starlight passes through the planet's atmosphere, and different molecules absorb specific wavelengths, creating absorption lines in the spectrum. During secondary eclipses (when the planet passes behind the star), we can measure the planet's thermal emission. Space telescopes like Hubble, Spitzer, and now James Webb Space Telescope have detected water vapor, methane, carbon dioxide, and other molecules in exoplanet atmospheres. Direct imaging of nearby exoplanets also allows atmospheric analysis."

However, we must be cautious of false positives - these molecules can also be produced by non-biological processes. The simultaneous detection of multiple biosignatures and the absence of obvious abiotic explanations would strengthen the case for life."

        "content": "Stellar metallicity (the abundance of elements heavier than hydrogen and helium) significantly influences planet formation. Higher metallicity stars are more likely to host planets, especially gas giants, because metals provide the solid building blocks for planetary cores. The core accretion model suggests that rocky/icy cores must reach a critical mass (~10 Earth masses) to rapidly accrete gas and form giant planets. Metal-rich environments provide more solid material for core formation. However, the relationship is complex - very high metallicity might lead to different planetary architectures, and lower metallicity stars can still form smaller rocky planets."

Similarly, when an exoplanet transits its star, it blocks a tiny fraction of starlight (typically 0.01-1%). By continuously monitoring star brightness and looking for these periodic dips, we can detect planets and determine their size, orbital period, and distance from the star."

It's most effective for large planets orbiting close to their stars, as they create deeper and more frequent transits. The Kepler Space Telescope used this method to discover over 2,600 confirmed exoplanets. However, it has limitations: we can only detect planets whose orbits are aligned with our line of sight (about 0.5% of all planetary systems), and it's biased toward finding short-period planets. Despite these limitations, it's been incredibly successful and remains one of our primary detection methods."
